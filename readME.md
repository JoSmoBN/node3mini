This mini project will cover the following:

~What is CORS and why do we use it?
   -Is CORS more or less secure than custom headers?
~What is express static and why do we use it?
~How to connect the front-end to the back-end

 We have set up a basic full stack application but we need you to complete the missing parts!

 Step 1
   Checkout server.js and see what's missing....

   Have we required everything we need?

   Things we will be adding are CORS or Cross Origin Resources Sharing.

   Wait!

   Normally you would do an "npm install --save cors" but since we have graciously bestowed
   upon you a package.json all you should have to do is "NPM INSTALL" <-- You will use this often when working in teams.
